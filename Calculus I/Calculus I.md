Today I returned back to [Calculus I](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1) course on Khan academy. I had a small pause as I realised that I need to close the knowledge gaps related to Algebra and Trigonometry. Today I focused on solving various limits using different techniques, such as factorization, conjugates, and trigonometric identities. Below is a helpful screenshot from Khan Academy showing strategies for finding limits (additional strategies will be introduced in more advanced calculus):

I learned about the squeeze theorem and finished another section in the first unit of the Calculus I course.
