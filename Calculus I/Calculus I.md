Today, I continue exploring the concept of derivatives. I'll leave a reminder here to take notes on:
- the definition of the derivative in terms of a limit. I will also need to explain the concept of a derivative by describing it as finding the slope of a line.
- When two points are far apart, connecting them forms a secant line, and we calculate its slope. However, as the distance between the x-values (Δx) approaches zero, the secant line increasingly resembles a tangent line. At that point, we calculate the slope of the tangent line.
- show an example for finding the derivative of x² at any point using the formal definition

I just finished the first section on derivatives and worked through a few quizzes with various problem types. I learned about the concepts of differentiability and continuity of functions. Later this evening, I'll take notes on everything I learned today.

Today, I began learning about differentiation. I found out about various derivative notations and worked through some basic problems to get familiar with the concept. I haven’t taken any notes yet, as I want to grasp the idea of differentiation fully before writing down notes in a way that makes sense to me.

I’ve finally finished the first unit of the Calculus I course on Khan Academy. Today, I learned about the Intermediate Value Theorem and worked through a few related problems. As usual, there was a unit test at the end, and this one had 31 questions. I got 30 of them right, but I was able to take a mastery challenge afterward to improve my score, which I did!

Tomorrow, I’m diving into the unit on derivatives, and I’m really excited for it.

Here’s my current progress in the Calculus I course:

Today, I spent time working on problems involving limits at infinity. I made sure to take notes on the key properties of limits, especially as I encountered challenges with some of the problems. Additionally, I wrote down some important rules for limits at infinity. You can find my notes below:

Today, I focused on learning about continuity over intervals, how to remove discontinuities, infinite limits, and limits approaching infinity. I still have a few more exercises to finish in the first unit, but I’m hopeful that I’ll complete it tomorrow and finally move on to the unit on derivatives.

Today I returned back to [Calculus I](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1) course on Khan academy. I had a small pause as I realised that I need to close the knowledge gaps related to Algebra and Trigonometry. Today I focused on solving various limits using different techniques, such as factorization, conjugates, and trigonometric identities. Below is a helpful screenshot from Khan Academy showing strategies for finding limits (additional strategies will be introduced in more advanced calculus):

*Time: 2:33 PM*

I learned about the squeeze theorem and finished another section in the first unit of the Calculus I course.
