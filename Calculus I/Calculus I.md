Later on I will continue the unit on function analysis.

*Time: 23:37 PM*

I've completed the second part of unit 5 in my Calculus 1 course. Just a few more lessons to go, and then I'll finally begin the unit on integrals.

I will need to take notes on:

- Second derivative test

---

*Date: 14 November 2024*

Today, I’m continuing to learn how to analyze concavity and identify inflection points. Recently, I've noticed that some topics seem harder than expected, possibly because I study late at night after work when my brain is a bit fatigued, or maybe these concepts just take more time for me to grasp. I'll keep studying this and other function-analysis topics until they "click" in my mind, allowing me to work through them more smoothly.

---

*Date: 12 November 2024*

Today, I took notes on what I've learned over the past few days: the Mean Value Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, critical points, and how to identify intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing:

*Date: 9 November 2024*

I’ve finally finished unit 4, and although it was shorter than previous ones, it was definitely challenging for me, personally, especially when it came to interpreting derivatives in real-life contexts. Closer the end, though, I noticed how I've improved with those types of problems, proving that it really came down to practice. This experience, once again, shows that the initial discomfort of learning something entirely new is just my brain adjusting, and overcoming that phase is only a matter of time.

---

*Date: 8 November 2024*

Today, I kept working on understanding and solving problems related to local linearity and L'Hôpital's rule. Tomorrow, my goal is to complete unit 4 and take notes on what I learned today.

---

*Date: 7 November 2024*
 
Today, I finished the second part of unit 4 in my Calculus 1 course. As I mentioned yesterday, I’ve taken all the notes I wanted to take:

I've also started learning about local linearity and will soon start studying about L'Hôpital's rule.

*Date: 6 November 2024*

Today, I continued studying the topic I had been struggling with, and finally, it clicked. I realized a couple of things that were preventing me from understanding related rates problems.

Here's an example of what I realized:

Imagine we have a right triangle, and one of its sides is growing at a rate of 1 cm per second. We need to find the rate of change of the hypotenuse's length. We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that $`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$.

In our case, we know that one of the sides (let's say $`a`$) is increasing at 1 cm per second, so $`\frac{da}{dt} = 1`$. We need to find $`\frac{dc}{dt}`$, the rate at which the hypotenuse $`c`$ is changing. To do this, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time $`t`$, treating each variable as a function of time and applying the chain rule:

$`2a \frac{da}{dt} + 2b \frac{db}{dt} = 2c \frac{dc}{dt}`$

**Important note**: only $`t`$ can be differentiated directly using rules like the power rule; other variables should be differentiated as functions of $t$.

Notes to take tomorrow:

- Explain in my own words how to differentiate with related rates using the example of changing geometric figures.

Tomorrow, I also want to complete the second part of Unit 4, where I have one more quiz left.

*Date: 5 November 2024*

Since it's my first few days at my new job, I have very little free time, but today I still continued solving problems related to applications of derivatives.

---

*Date: 3 November 2024*

Today I only had a little bit of free time, but I decided to solve a few problems related to applications of derivatives. I won't lie, I find this challenging. While calculating different types of derivatives can be straightforward, applying that knowledge to real-world problems feels much harder for me. I think it's just a matter of gaining experience with these types of questions, so most likely it will get easier over time, just like anything else.

---

*Date: 2 November 2024*

*Time: 1:26 PM*

Today, I started unit 4 of my calculus 1 course, which focuses on the application of derivatives. I worked on some problems, like interpreting the meaning of derivatives in various contexts, etc.

*Date: 25 October 2024*

Today, I spent some time going over the proofs for what I studied yesterday. I haven’t fully grasped the concepts yet since it was a late-night session, but I'll continue working on them tomorrow.

---

*Date: 24 October 2024*

Today, I studied derivatives of trigonometric functions, derivative of $`e^x`$, and the derivative of natural logarithm. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to take all the notes I planned, so I'll probably take them at the end of the unit. Here's what I still need to note:

- Derivatives of trigonometric functions ✅
- Derivative of $`e^x`$ ✅
- Derivative of the natural logarithm ✅

Next, I want to dive into the proofs of concepts I covered today, finish the second unit, and write notes on everything I had planned.

---

*Date: 23 October 2024*

*Time: 7:08 PM*

Today, I studied the power rule and worked through a few related problems. I'll again leave a reminder here to take notes on:
- differentiability and continuity ✅
- power rule ✅

</p>

*Time: 11:43 PM*

I just completed the second section on derivatives, which was mostly about the power rule and basic derivative rules. I went through various problem types and finished all the necessary exercises. Tomorrow, I plan to start by reviewing and taking notes on what I learned today and highlight the key points to remember.

*Date: 20 October 2024*

*Time: 2:49 PM*

Today, I continue exploring the concept of derivatives. I'll leave a reminder here to take notes on:
- the definition of the derivative in terms of a limit. I will also need to explain the concept of a derivative by describing it as finding the slope of a line.
- When two points are far apart, connecting them forms a secant line, and we calculate its slope. However, as the distance between the x-values (Δx) approaches zero, the secant line increasingly resembles a tangent line. At that point, we calculate the slope of the tangent line.
- show an example for finding the derivative of x² at any point using the formal definition

*Time: 6:05 PM*

I just finished the first section on derivatives and worked through a few quizzes with various problem types. I learned about the concepts of differentiability and continuity of functions. Later this evening, I'll take notes on everything I learned today.

*Time: 9:23 PM*

I completed taking notes on all the topics I had planned to cover, as mentioned earlier. I’ve explained them in a way that reflects my initial understanding of derivatives, as this type of explanation usually helps me grasp the concepts more effectively. Here are the notes:

*Date: 19 October 2024*

Today, I began learning about differentiation. I found out about various derivative notations and worked through some basic problems to get familiar with the concept. I haven’t taken any notes yet, as I want to grasp the idea of differentiation fully before writing down notes in a way that makes sense to me.

---

*Date: 16 October 2024*

I’ve finally finished the first unit of the Calculus I course on Khan Academy. Today, I learned about the Intermediate Value Theorem and worked through a few related problems. As usual, there was a unit test at the end, and this one had 31 questions. I got 30 of them right, but I was able to take a mastery challenge afterward to improve my score, which I did!

Tomorrow, I’m diving into the unit on derivatives, and I’m really excited for it.

Here’s my current progress in the Calculus I course:

*Date: 14 October 2024*

Today, I focused on learning about continuity over intervals, how to remove discontinuities, infinite limits, and limits approaching infinity. I still have a few more exercises to finish in the first unit, but I’m hopeful that I’ll complete it tomorrow and finally move on to the unit on derivatives.

---

*Date: 13 October 2024*

*Time: 12:29 PM*

Today I returned back to [Calculus I](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1) course on Khan academy. I had a small pause as I realised that I need to close the knowledge gaps related to Algebra and Trigonometry. Today I focused on solving various limits using different techniques, such as factorization, conjugates, and trigonometric identities. Below is a helpful screenshot from Khan Academy showing strategies for finding limits (additional strategies will be introduced in more advanced calculus):
