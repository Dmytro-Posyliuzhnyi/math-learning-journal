I came across an interesting video on trigonometry concepts and took notes while watching it. I've shared them below.

Today, I was still going through the video I shared yesterday. Specifically, I focused on the last part explaining the unit circle and its relation to trigonometric functions. One of the difficulties I faced was understanding why the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the circle are equal to (cos θ, sin θ). I tried playing around with the coordinate plane on Desmos, but I still need a bit more time to process it. Additionally, while searching for the answer on the internet, I found an interesting [resource](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/precalculus/chapter/unit-circle-sine-and-cosine-functions) that explains the same concepts. I took a glance, and it seems fine. Maybe I'll look at it more deeply later on.
