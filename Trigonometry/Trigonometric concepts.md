I came across an interesting video on trigonometry concepts and took notes while watching it. I've shared them below.

Today, I was still going through the video I shared yesterday. Specifically, I focused on the last part explaining the unit circle and its relation to trigonometric functions. One of the difficulties I faced was understanding why the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the circle are equal to (cos θ, sin θ). I tried playing around with the coordinate plane on Desmos, but I still need a bit more time to process it. Additionally, while searching for the answer on the internet, I found an interesting [resource](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/precalculus/chapter/unit-circle-sine-and-cosine-functions) that explains the same concepts. I took a glance, and it seems fine. Maybe I'll look at it more deeply later on.

Today, I solved the issue I had yesterday. A cool thing is that I realized what was preventing me from understanding it not while studying, but randomly during work. Quick reminder: I couldn't understand why the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit circle are (cos θ, sin θ). But today, I figured out that I had overlooked a simple fact:

Since the hypotenuse in a unit circle equals 1, the equation sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse simplifies to sin θ = Opposite, and similarly, cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse simplifies to cos θ = Adjacent. Therefore, the length of the adjacent side equals cos θ, which corresponds to the x-coordinate, and the length of the opposite side equals sin θ, which corresponds to the y-coordinate.

I’m not sure if this explanation makes as much sense in writing as it does in my head, but if anyone reading this is struggling with the same concept, feel free to reach out to me anywhere, and I'll explain it in simple terms.

Today, I continued my Algebra II course on Khan Academy, and one of the final units covers [Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:trig).

*Time: 3:15 PM*

I've finished the first part of the unit, including all the exercises. Two more parts to go.

I'm back from a longest vacation in my life, almost 2 weeks.

Today I continued [Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:trig) unit in Algebra II course on Khan academy. Took some notes on Amplitude, Period and Midline of waves.

Also I found out about general form of a trig function, I will take notes about it later, but sharing the screenshot of the idea just in case I will forget:

Today, I continued my Trigonometry studies and, as I mentioned yesterday, I came across the general form of a trigonometric function. Today, I examined it deeper. I took notes explaining the main components and equations, such as amplitude, period, horizontal shift (phase shift), vertical shift, and the midline. I also practiced drawing trigonometric functions based on their equations. Tomorrow, I plan to keep practicing and challenge myself to reverse the process by deriving the equation from a given trigonometric function.

Here are my notes, which complement the ones I made yesterday:

Today, I dedicated my time to practicing what I've learned about trigonometric functions. As I mentioned yesterday, I focused on getting equations given graphs of sinusoidal functions. I also faced some interesting challenges involving real-world applications. I won't lie, trigonometric functions were quite tough for me initially. Even today, there were moments where certain problems felt challenging. However, I'm proud that I pushed through, and by the end of the day, things started to click, making it much easier. If I would have stopped, I wouldn't have experienced this progress.

Additionally, I have finally completed trigonometry unit in Algebra II course on Khan Academy. I have two more units left and Algebra II will be completed:
