I came across an interesting video on trigonometry concepts and took notes while watching it. I've shared them below.

Today, I was still going through the video I shared yesterday. Specifically, I focused on the last part explaining the unit circle and its relation to trigonometric functions. One of the difficulties I faced was understanding why the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the circle are equal to (cos θ, sin θ). I tried playing around with the coordinate plane on Desmos, but I still need a bit more time to process it. Additionally, while searching for the answer on the internet, I found an interesting [resource](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/precalculus/chapter/unit-circle-sine-and-cosine-functions) that explains the same concepts. I took a glance, and it seems fine. Maybe I'll look at it more deeply later on.

Today, I solved the issue I had yesterday. A cool thing is that I realized what was preventing me from understanding it not while studying, but randomly during work. Quick reminder: I couldn't understand why the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit circle are (cos θ, sin θ). But today, I figured out that I had overlooked a simple fact:

Since the hypotenuse in a unit circle equals 1, the equation sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse simplifies to sin θ = Opposite, and similarly, cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse simplifies to cos θ = Adjacent. Therefore, the length of the adjacent side equals cos θ, which corresponds to the x-coordinate, and the length of the opposite side equals sin θ, which corresponds to the y-coordinate.

I’m not sure if this explanation makes as much sense in writing as it does in my head, but if anyone reading this is struggling with the same concept, feel free to reach out to me anywhere, and I'll explain it in simple terms.
