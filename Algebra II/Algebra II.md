Today, I finally finished the [Algebra II](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2) course on Khan Academy.

It took me some time to complete, as I wanted to make sure I had a solid understanding of basic algebra before moving on to Calculus. My first attempt at starting Calculus made me realize I had some gaps in prerequisites like algebra and trigonometry. Now, I feel much more confident with these topics. If I encounter any gaps as I progress through Calculus, I'll address them when necessary rather than dragging this out.

As you can see, I finished the course with 93% mastery. I skipped Unit 9 because it felt repetitive and familiar, so I focused on areas I needed to improve. Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, and my next step will be starting Calculus I.
