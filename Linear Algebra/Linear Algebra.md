*Date: February 2, 2025*

Learned more about **image of a subset under a transformation** and **im(T): Image of a transformation**. At the end of the lesson 1, I will take notes on that topic.

---

*Date: February 1, 2025*

Started Unit 2 and explored a more formal definition of functions in the context of transformations. Since transformations were partially covered in the Algebra II course, some videos in the Linear Algebra course are duplicated. However, I'm still reviewing some of them just to make sure I haven't missed any key concepts.

---

*Date: January 25, 2025*

*Time: 12:43 PM*

Completed Unit 1. The last three topics mainly focused on **rank** ✅ and its relationship to column space and nullity ✅. Now I'm starting to write notes on everything I've planned.

*Time: 5:08 PM*

Took almost all the notes I had planned to. I decided to skip some topics I wanted to note as at the moment they seem to be redundant.

*Date: January 24, 2025*

*Time: 7:02 PM*

Today, I learned about and need to take notes on:

- The column space of a matrix ✅
- Free variables ✅
- The null space and the column space basis ✅
- I also need to write notes on matrix-vector multiplication because I feel like I might have mixed it up in my mind ❌

*Time: 10:50 PM*

Learned more about the column space of a matrix. I might also need to take notes on how to find the formula for the column space using the example shown in [this video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/null-column-space/v/visualizing-a-column-space-as-a-plane-in-r3). ❌

*Time: 11:20 PM*

Need to take additional notes on the **pivot columns of a matrix forming a basis for the column space. Also remember to mention free variables (non-pivot columns)** ✅. I also need to revisit and take a few notes on **nullity** ✅, as the notes I took yesterday are not giving me a clear understanding.

Tomorrow, I have a lot to do, but I would try to find time for math as I'd love to finish Unit 1 on Linear Algebra, which seems quite lengthy. I still have three more topics to cover. After that, I'll take all the notes and start Unit 2.

---

*Date: January 23, 2025*

*Time: 8:04 PM*

Took notes on  **row-echelon form**. Today, later on I will continue taking notes on **null space**.

*Time: 11:27 PM*

Finalized the notes:

---

*Date: January 21, 2025*

Today, I learned more about **row-echelon form**. I had previously planned to take notes on this topic but postponed it, and now seems like a good time to do so. I also learned about the **null space**, how to calculate it, and its relation to linear independence. Before starting the next topics, it would be nice to take notes on the ones I've learned about today and develop more intuition behind them.

---

*Date: January 19, 2025*

*Time: 2:19 PM*

I took all the notes I planned, except for inverting a 3x3 matrix using Gaussian elimination or determinants. I realized those notes might be unnecessary and would just be notes for the sake of it.

---

*Date: January 18, 2025*

*Time: 2:08 PM*

Learned about and need to take notes on:

- Determinant of a 3x3 matrix ✅
- Inverting a 3x3 matrix using Gaussian elimination ❌

I'm not sure if it makes sense to write notes on inverting a 3x3 matrix using determinants, as it's computationally intensive and doesn't bring much value at this point. But actually, it’s a nice exercise, so I might still write it down to warm up my brain. 

*Time: 2:30 PM*

Additional topics to note down:

- Expressing linear systems as matrix ✅
- Basics of solving linear systems using matrices ✅

Finished the matrices unit (from the Algebra II course) and switching back to the Linear Algebra course.

---

*Date: January 17, 2025*

*Time: 8:36 PM*

Completed notes on the basics of linear transformations:

*Time: 10:20 PM*

Learned about and need to take notes on:

- determinant of a 2x2 matrix ✅
- intro to matrix inverses ✅

---

*Date: January 16, 2025*

Today I took notes on transformation of vectors using matrices, explanation of word "transformation" and more rigorous definition of **linear transformation**.

Tomorrow I will share the notes here, I need to finish them first.

---

*Date: January 15, 2025*

Today, I finished the introductory part on linear transformations. During the next study session, I will review the introduction to linear transformations once again and take notes on it (leaving this link here to remember to review it: [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/linear-transformations)). 

I need to hurry and finish the Linear Algebra course on Khan Academy so I can move on to Calculus 2, as it seems like it's taking longer than usual because of other things I try to learn.

---

*Date: January 9, 2025*

Today, I learned about and need to take notes on:

- Transforming vectors using matrices ✅
- Matrices as transformations ✅

Most likely, for now I will take only introductory notes on matrices as transformations, as currently these topics are based on Algebra 2 course and later on when I will switch back to Linear Algebra course, with high probability it will cover more advanced topics related to matrices transformations.

---

*Date: January 8, 2025*

Took all notes I had planned recently:

---

*Date: January 6, 2025*

I've finally returned to studying math. Over the past couple of weeks, I was focused more on machine learning, but I realized I need to stay consistent with math as well. Today, I learned about and need to take notes on:

- Matrices Multiplication ✅
- Defined Matrix Operations ✅
- Intro to Identity Matrix ✅
  - Dimensions of identity matrix ✅
- Properties of Matrix Multiplication ✅

---

*Date: 27 December 2024*

*Time: 1:36 PM*

Additional notes I need to take:
- Multiplying matrices by scalars ✅
- Properties of matrix addition ✅
- Properties of matrix scalar multiplication ✅

*Time: 2:15 PM*

Took all the notes I had planned, except for the notes on reduced row echelon form. I decided to postpone this topic until the moment when I actively start solving linear systems of equations. Maybe then I'll be able to structure it in a better way.

---

*Date: 26 December 2024*

I will need to take notes on:

- reduced row echelon form ❌
- adding & subtracting matrices ✅

For the last couple of days I'm more focused on ML and trying to apply the math knowledge I've built in ML. It gives me a much clearer picture as I find most of the topics understandable just because I've been going through them while learning math, so that's great. At the same time I'm trying to keep up learning more advanced math topics as the are still a lot of them uncovered which will help me much more in future.

---

*Date: 25 December 2024*

Today I made notes on the introductory topics related to matrices as planned:

---

*Date: 23 December 2024*

Before moving on to the next videos in the Linear Algebra course, which are related to matrices, I decided to go through the unit on matrices from the Algebra course to refresh my basic knowledge of matrices. I will need to take notes on:

- Introduction to matrices ✅
- Representing linear systems with matrices ✅
- Matrix row operations ✅
- Examples of solving simple systems of equations ✅

---

*Date: 22 December 2024*

*Time: 1:05 PM*

Complementing the notes I need to take:

- Point distance to plane ✅
- Distance between planes ✅

*Time: 9:13 PM*

*Date: 18 December 2024*

Learned about the following topics and need to take notes on them:
- Lagrange's Formula ✅
- Normal vector from plane equation ✅ 
- Following notation of vector: $`\displaystyle \vec{v} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}`$ ✅

*Date: 15 December 2024*

Today, I learned a lot about the dot product and the cross product. As I was already mentioning during my Calculus course, sometimes when I can't get an intuition for a concept, I just need to consistently keep learning, and eventually, it will click. That moment happened today - I finally got the intuition behind the dot product and the cross product. I will need to takes notes on:
- cross product ✅
- relationship between cross product and sin of angle (with proof) ✅
- Dot and cross product comparison/intuition [(Reference video)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/dot-cross-products/v/dot-and-cross-product-comparison-intuition) ✅

I have a couple of videos left before I start working with matrices. I found an introduction to matrices in the Precalculus course on Khan Academy, and I may need to take a look at it to grasp the basic concepts. [(Matrices | Precalculus)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices)

*Date: 14 December 2024*

*Time: 1:08 PM*

Learned about vector triangle inequality.

*Time: 4:13 PM*

Learned about definition of the angle between vectors. 

Later on I will write notes on both topics I learned today and will try to connect this with what I've learned previously.

*Time: 9:32 PM*

Took notes on vector triangle inequality and angle between vectors:

*Date: 12 December 2024*

Today, I took notes on what I planned yesterday:

<img width="300" alt="Page 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b73ebc58-b458-413f-b04a-281b6b2acbbe">

As I mentioned in the notes, for now, they're too abstract and general, but later on, I will try to connect these concepts to get a clearer picture of what they mean.

---

*Date: 11 December 2024*

Today, I learned about the following topics and need to take notes on them:

- Vector dot product ✅
- Vector length ✅
- Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and its proof ✅

---

*Date: 10 December 2024*

I complemented my notes on linear dependence and independence and also took notes on linear subspaces and the basis of a subspace. It's a bit challenging to take notes while watching explanations with visual animations, as my notes end up being purely text-based. I'm afraid that later on, when I will refine these notes, I might face some difficulties. Additionally, the amount of notes for the Linear Algebra course seems higher than usual because many concepts are new to me, but I just don't want to lose any important information, so I'm trying to write down everything that helps me understand the bigger picture.

---

*Date: 9 December 2024*

Today, I watched additional videos on linear dependence and independence. I plan to take more notes on this topic, as I want to include more examples and a more rigorous definition. Additionally, I have started learning about linear subspaces and the basis of a subspace, so I will also need to take notes on that. 

I came across [notes on subspaces](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/subspaces.html) (along with other related topics) from the Georgia Institute of Technology, which I can use as a reference when I'm gonna take notes.

---

*Date: 8 December 2024*

Finished notes on linear combinations, span, and a bit on linear dependence and independence:

I really wanted to draw a three-dimensional space to explain the concept of span, but when I tried, it felt too ambitious for my drawing skills. However, I think I'll improve with practice because most concepts click for me when I visualize them, either using Desmos or purely in my head. I think this could be valuable, but I won't lie, I enjoy the process of drawing things like that.

---

*Date: 7 December 2024*

*Time: 11:10 PM*

I watched videos on linear combinations and span and took notes on them, but I haven't finished yet. I plan to finish tomorrow and share the notes here. I also discovered the 3Blue1Brown website, which has excellent lessons on Linear Algebra. I've watched it's videos on YouTube before but never knew about the website - it seems to be a great place to learn about this topic.

*Time: 7:17 PM*

Today, I took notes on unit vectors and the parametric representation of lines. I decided to skip the notes on how to find magnitudes, the parallelogram rule, and typical notations, as they seem redundant at this point. Here are the notes:

<img width="300" alt="Page 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff741800-0723-45bb-b793-dc1babadbd96">
<img width="300" alt="Page 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a6592ef-3ba1-492c-9ebf-7f137477b8a2">
<img width="300" alt="Page 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101d4a67-af83-4a4a-8bce-965dc506de62">

I feel like it's going slower than I expected, mainly because I don't yet see the bigger picture of linear algebra. It was the same when I started Calculus, I had a similar issue at the beginning, but it was solved just by learning and practicing more, so I will have the same approach with Linear Algebra.

---

*Date: 6 December 2024*

Today I solved a couple more problems related to unit vectors. Later on I will also need to take a notes on __typical notations used in linear algebra__.

---

*Date: 5 December 2024*

Today, I spent a little time studying math. I learned about unit vectors, but I'll need to gather more information on the topic because later on during the exercises some aspects weren't entirely clear. I also learned about the parallelogram rule for vector addition. To make sure I don't forget to take notes, I'll leave a list here:

- unit vector
- how to find magnitude
- parallelogram rule
 
---

*Date: 3 December 2024*

Today I took notes on the topics I've mentioned yesterday and also I watched a couple of videos from Linear Algebra course.

*Date: 2 December 2024*

*Time: 5:47 PM*

After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

*Time: 6:09 PM*

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction) ✅
- real coordinate spaces ✅
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically) ✅

*Time: 9:14 PM*

While searching for info on Linear Algebra, I found this cool [document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/nbio228-01/handouts/Ch4_Linear_Algebra.pdf) from Stanford that explains the basic concepts. I'll definitely use it for my notes and maybe find more stuff like it!
