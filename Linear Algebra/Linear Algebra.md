After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

Time: 6:09 PM

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction)
- real coordinate spaces
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically)
