After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

*Time: 6:09 PM*

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction)
- real coordinate spaces
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically)

*Time: 9:14 PM*

While searching for info on Linear Algebra, I found this cool [document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/nbio228-01/handouts/Ch4_Linear_Algebra.pdf) from Stanford that explains the basic concepts. I'll definitely use it for my notes and maybe find more stuff like it!
