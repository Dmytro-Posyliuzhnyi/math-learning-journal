Finished notes on linear combinations, span, and a bit on linear dependence and independence:

I really wanted to draw a three-dimensional space to explain the concept of span, but when I tried, it felt too ambitious for my drawing skills. However, I think I'll improve with practice because most concepts click for me when I visualize them, either using Desmos or purely in my head. I think this could be valuable, but I won't lie, I enjoy the process of drawing things like that.

I watched videos on linear combinations and span and took notes on them, but I haven't finished yet. I plan to finish tomorrow and share the notes here. I also discovered the 3Blue1Brown website, which has excellent lessons on Linear Algebra. I've watched it's videos on YouTube before but never knew about the website - it seems to be a great place to learn about this topic.

*Time: 7:17 PM*

Today, I took notes on unit vectors and the parametric representation of lines. I decided to skip the notes on how to find magnitudes, the parallelogram rule, and typical notations, as they seem redundant at this point. Here are the notes:

I feel like it's going slower than I expected, mainly because I don't yet see the bigger picture of linear algebra. It was the same when I started Calculus, I had a similar issue at the beginning, but it was solved just by learning and practicing more, so I will have the same approach with Linear Algebra.

Today I solved a couple more problems related to unit vectors. Later on I will also need to take a notes on __typical notations used in linear algebra__.

Today, I spent a little time studying math. I learned about unit vectors, but I'll need to gather more information on the topic because later on during the exercises some aspects weren't entirely clear. I also learned about the parallelogram rule for vector addition. To make sure I don't forget to take notes, I'll leave a list here:

- unit vector
- how to find magnitude
- parallelogram rule

Today I took notes on the topics I've mentioned yesterday and also I watched a couple of videos from Linear Algebra course.

After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

*Time: 6:09 PM*

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction) ✅
- real coordinate spaces ✅
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically) ✅

*Time: 9:14 PM*

While searching for info on Linear Algebra, I found this cool [document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/nbio228-01/handouts/Ch4_Linear_Algebra.pdf) from Stanford that explains the basic concepts. I'll definitely use it for my notes and maybe find more stuff like it!
