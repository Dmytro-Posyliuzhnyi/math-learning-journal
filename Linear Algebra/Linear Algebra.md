Today, I spent a little time studying math. I learned about unit vectors, but I'll need to gather more information on the topic because later on during the exercises some aspects weren't entirely clear. I also learned about the parallelogram rule for vector addition. To make sure I don't forget to take notes, I'll leave a list here:

- unit vector
- how to find magnitude
- parallelogram rule

Today I took notes on the topics I've mentioned yesterday and also I watched a couple of videos from Linear Algebra course.

After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

*Time: 6:09 PM*

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction) ✅
- real coordinate spaces ✅
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically) ✅

*Time: 9:14 PM*

While searching for info on Linear Algebra, I found this cool [document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/nbio228-01/handouts/Ch4_Linear_Algebra.pdf) from Stanford that explains the basic concepts. I'll definitely use it for my notes and maybe find more stuff like it!
