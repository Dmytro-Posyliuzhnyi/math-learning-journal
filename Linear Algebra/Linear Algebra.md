- Introduction to matrices ✅
- Representing linear systems with matrices ✅
- Matrix row operations ✅
- Examples of solving simple systems of equations ✅

*Date: 22 December 2024*

*Time: 1:05 PM*

Complementing the notes I need to take:

- Point distance to plane ✅
- Distance between planes ✅

*Time: 9:13 PM*

Today, I learned a lot about the dot product and the cross product. As I was already mentioning during my Calculus course, sometimes when I can't get an intuition for a concept, I just need to consistently keep learning, and eventually, it will click. That moment happened today - I finally got the intuition behind the dot product and the cross product. I will need to takes notes on:
- cross product ✅
- relationship between cross product and sin of angle (with proof) ✅
- Dot and cross product comparison/intuition [(Reference video)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/dot-cross-products/v/dot-and-cross-product-comparison-intuition) ✅

I have a couple of videos left before I start working with matrices. I found an introduction to matrices in the Precalculus course on Khan Academy, and I may need to take a look at it to grasp the basic concepts.

*Time: 1:08 PM*

Learned about vector triangle inequality.

*Time: 4:13 PM*

Learned about definition of the angle between vectors. 

Later on I will write notes on both topics I learned today and will try to connect this with what I've learned previously.

*Time: 9:32 PM*

Took notes on vector triangle inequality and angle between vectors:

Today, I took notes on what I planned yesterday:

As I mentioned in the notes, for now, they're too abstract and general, but later on, I will try to connect these concepts to get a clearer picture of what they mean.

*Date: 11 December 2024*

Today, I learned about the following topics and need to take notes on them:

- Vector dot product ✅
- Vector length ✅
- Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and its proof ✅

*Date: 10 December 2024*

I complemented my notes on linear dependence and independence and also took notes on linear subspaces and the basis of a subspace. It's a bit challenging to take notes while watching explanations with visual animations, as my notes end up being purely text-based. I'm afraid that later on, when I will refine these notes, I might face some difficulties. Additionally, the amount of notes for the Linear Algebra course seems higher than usual because many concepts are new to me, but I just don't want to lose any important information, so I'm trying to write down everything that helps me understand the bigger picture.

*Date: 9 December 2024*

Today, I watched additional videos on linear dependence and independence. I plan to take more notes on this topic, as I want to include more examples and a more rigorous definition. Additionally, I have started learning about linear subspaces and the basis of a subspace, so I will also need to take notes on that. 

I came across [notes on subspaces](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/subspaces.html) (along with other related topics) from the Georgia Institute of Technology, which I can use as a reference when I'm gonna take notes.

*Date: 8 December 2024*

Finished notes on linear combinations, span, and a bit on linear dependence and independence:

I really wanted to draw a three-dimensional space to explain the concept of span, but when I tried, it felt too ambitious for my drawing skills. However, I think I'll improve with practice because most concepts click for me when I visualize them, either using Desmos or purely in my head. I think this could be valuable, but I won't lie, I enjoy the process of drawing things like that.

I watched videos on linear combinations and span and took notes on them, but I haven't finished yet. I plan to finish tomorrow and share the notes here. I also discovered the 3Blue1Brown website, which has excellent lessons on Linear Algebra. I've watched it's videos on YouTube before but never knew about the website - it seems to be a great place to learn about this topic.

*Time: 7:17 PM*

Today, I took notes on unit vectors and the parametric representation of lines. I decided to skip the notes on how to find magnitudes, the parallelogram rule, and typical notations, as they seem redundant at this point. Here are the notes:

<img width="300" alt="Page 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff741800-0723-45bb-b793-dc1babadbd96">

I feel like it's going slower than I expected, mainly because I don't yet see the bigger picture of linear algebra. It was the same when I started Calculus, I had a similar issue at the beginning, but it was solved just by learning and practicing more, so I will have the same approach with Linear Algebra.

*Date: 6 December 2024*

Today I solved a couple more problems related to unit vectors. Later on I will also need to take a notes on __typical notations used in linear algebra__.

---

*Date: 5 December 2024*

Today, I spent a little time studying math. I learned about unit vectors, but I'll need to gather more information on the topic because later on during the exercises some aspects weren't entirely clear. I also learned about the parallelogram rule for vector addition. To make sure I don't forget to take notes, I'll leave a list here:

- unit vector
- how to find magnitude
- parallelogram rule

*Date: 3 December 2024*

Today I took notes on the topics I've mentioned yesterday and also I watched a couple of videos from Linear Algebra course.

*Time: 5:47 PM*

After completing a Calculus I course, I decided to start learning Linear Algebra. I'll begin with Khan Academy, but I also came across an interesting beginner-level Linear Algebra course on Coursera, so I might continue there afterward.

*Time: 6:09 PM*

At the start, I'll probably have a bunch of notes to take, so here are some of them:

- intro to vectors (magnitude and direction) ✅
- real coordinate spaces ✅
- adding vectors (both algebraically and graphically) ✅

*Time: 9:14 PM*

While searching for info on Linear Algebra, I found this cool [document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/nbio228-01/handouts/Ch4_Linear_Algebra.pdf) from Stanford that explains the basic concepts. I'll definitely use it for my notes and maybe find more stuff like it!

*Time: 9:42 PM*
